A portable sub-GHz RF signal Multi-Tool built on the ESP32-C3 SuperMini with a CC1101 radio module, created to push the boundaries. FreqFoxRF scans, detects, logs, and replays wireless signals across common ISM bands - all from a compact handheld device with a 0,96" 128×64 I2C OLED display and 5-button navigation.

#### STILL IN DEVELOPMENT!

## Installation

The source code is not made publicly available due to ungrateful individuals that previously stole my projects to profit from the sale of my devices without any attribution, ignoring the included project license. Install FreqFoxRF by flashing the pre-compiled binary. Hopefully we will warp into a future where such consequences are not required...

### Option 1 - esptool (Command Line)

Make sure Python and esptool are installed:

```bash
pip install esptool
```

Then flash with:

```bash
python -m esptool --chip esp32c3 --port COM16 --baud 115200 write_flash ^
  0x0 FreqFoxRF.bootloader.bin ^
  0x8000 FreqFoxRF.partitions.bin ^
  0x10000 FreqFoxRF.bin
```

> Replace `COM16` with your actual serial port!

To erase the chip before flashing (recommended for first install):

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port COM16 erase_flash
```

### Option 2 - ESP Flash Download Tool (Windows GUI)

1. Download the [ESP Flash Download Tool](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools) from Espressif
2. Select chip: **ESP32-C3**
3. Add `freqfoxrf.bin` at offset `0x0`
4. Select your COM port, set baud to `460800`
5. Click **START**

### Option 3 - Web Flasher

A browser-based flasher (no drivers required) may be available via [ESP Web Tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/) - check the releases page for a hosted installer link.

## Notes

- The CC1101 uses OOK energy detection for RSSI-based scanning across all bands, this allows reliable detection of both OOK and FSK devices without needing to match modulation
- 868 MHz detection requires the device to be reasonably close to the signal source due to the CC1101's reduced sensitivity above 700 MHz
- Saved signals persist across reboots via EEPROM (up to 20 signals, 2048 bytes total)
- Raw capture stores pulse timings for signals that fall outside known protocol formats
- in active development, features will be added!

## UI & Display

The FreqFoxRF display graphics were designed using **[Lopaka](https://lopaka.app)** - a free, browser-based UI editor for embedded displays. If you're building anything that makes pixels go "Beep, Boop! 0 1", Lopaka lets you visually design your layouts and exports ready-to-use code directly. No more guessing pixel coordinates by hand.

Seriously worth bookmarking if you do any embedded UI work: **https://lopaka.app**
Special thanks to Lopaka.app for sponsoring and supporting by this!
